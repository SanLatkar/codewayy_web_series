            <h1>The Components of Life & Death:<br> Time, Energy, Information</h1>
            <p>
                Sadhguru looks at how life and death are essentially a play of time, information and energy, and how we can become absolutely free if we conduct these three consciously.

                        When a human being is born, a certain software is set within him, which is a combination of time, energy and the information that he carries with him. These three together will determine various aspects of life.These three together will even determine how long a human being lives and how he lives.If you can conduct all these three things consciously, you are free in every way – 100% free. That's liberation. That's mukti.

                            <p>
                                In yogic perception, time is the basic aspect of creation. It is because of time that there is gravity and because of gravity, everything else. ... The physical exists only because time – which is nothingness – takes a curve. The word “time” itself may not conjure that image in most people's minds

                                One level of energy is the food that you eat, the water that you drink, the air that you breathe and the sunlight that you receive. These things become the day-to-day energy that you experience. Another way of looking at it is that what you call “life” or what you call “myself” is energy. How alive and wakeful you are is how energetic you are.

                            <p>
                                memory is just a doorway – if doors are opening for you, it can be a wonderful thing, but if they are closing in your face, you see it as horrible. ... But at the same time it's human memory which is the source of all bondage. What you call as karma is just memory on different levels of life.
