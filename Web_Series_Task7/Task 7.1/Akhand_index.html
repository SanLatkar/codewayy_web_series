                <h2>Akhand Bharat</h2>
                <p>When asked to comment on Madhav’s statement on ‘Akhand Bharat (united India)’, Sinha said it is a political issue and that Bharatiya Janata Party should answer that as to why he made such statement and what he means by his ‘Akhand Bharat’.“For RSS Akhand Bharat is not a programme, it is our ideal; that this land is one India, which is called as punya bhumi (sacred land)”, he added.</p>
                <p>“The division of India was unnatural, but that can be undone only when people of Bangladesh and Pakistan, accept pre-Islamic Indian culture and ethos that is based on Indonesian model. It is cultural concept, not a political one”.Ram Madhav, had earlier said that the Sangh believes that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh will one day reunite again not by war but through “popular goodwill”, the comment came when Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise stopover in Lahore for a meeting with Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.</p>
